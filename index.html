      What is the Panther Lounge?
   </h1>
   <!-- add a map iframe higlighting EH -->
   <p>
      The Panther Lounge is recreational space open to
      all Florida Tech students. The lounge is owned by Florida
      Tech's Student Government Association, but it is co-run by
      The Anime Club and the Florida Institute of Technology
      Science Fiction and Fantasy Club (FITSSFF).
   </p>
   <h1>
      What does it do?
   </h1>
   <p>
      The Panther Lounge Database and Checkout System
      is a web application designed to help both Anime
      Club and FITSSFF catalog and organize their expansive
      libraries. The web application is also designed to
      make the checkout system for members and club librarians
      to use.
   </p>
   <h1>
      How were items previously cataloged?
   </h1>
   <p>
      Items were previously cataloged on a series of spreadsheets.
      Both clubs end up with a number of newly-dontated items each
      semester, so catalogging them often becomes unnecessarily
      tedious for both librarians, who are already busy with classwork.
   </p>
   <h1>
      What was wrong with the old checkout system?
   </h1>
   <p>
      Each club had their own Google Form. Members would fill out
      either form to notify an item was being checked out. Both
      Google Forms are disconnected to the aforementioned
      spreadsheets. Items were often difficult to track,
      In extreme cases, items were stolen, sometimes by non-members.
   </p>
   <h1>
      How is our project better than the old systems?
   </h1>
   <p>
      The catalogs and checkout system will be localized on the web app.
      Localizating the two will make it easier for members and librarians
      from both clubs so catalog, checkout, and track items. This will
      also help both clubs with holding members accountable in the event
      an item goes missing.
